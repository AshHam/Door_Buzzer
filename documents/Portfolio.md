# The Door Buzzer

## Project brief

You have been asked to design and build a prototype _door buzzer_.  
The buzzer can be affixed to a door handle.  
The door buzzer should make a sound when activated to let the room's occupier know there is somebody wishing to enter.  

## Research

_As part of your research, it is important to see which products are already on the market and to evaluate how effective they are._
_Use the Web, to find three other door buzzers that can be purchased or made._
_For each of the buzzers you look at, make a note of the URL, save an image and write a few lines outlining the advantages and disadvantages of the product design._

### Product 1

## Gantt Chart
_Insert or link to your Gantt chart here_

## Initial Circuit Design
_Describe here why you can't simply place contacts in your circuit that would allow your finger to complete the circuit._

## Transistors
_Give a basic description of a how a transistor works_

## Darlington Pair
_Give a basic description for how a Darlington Pair works_

## Circuit Design
_Insert a screenshot of your circuit design and describe how the circuit works_

## PCB Design
_Insert a screenshot of your PCB design and describe how it was designed._

## Testing the PCB
_Describe how you tested that the PCB would work and accounted for the resistance of human skin._

## Case Design
_Insert an export (PNG is best), of your case design, and describe how it meets the needs of the project._

## Drilling the PCB
_Insert a photo of your drilled PCB and annotate it with the sizes of the holes._

## Soldering
_Insert a photo or photos of your soldering. Make sure you also include a photo of your LED with the flying leads._

## Case Assembly
_Insert photos here showing how you assembled your case, and describe the process of line-bending._

## Testing
_Insert photos (or video) of your finished project, showing it working._

## Evaluation
_Evaluate your performance on the project. Ensure you talk about key points such as time management, soldering quality, problems you encountered and how you overcame them._
